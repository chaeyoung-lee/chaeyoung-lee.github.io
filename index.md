## About me
I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford, interested in the intersection of mobile embedded systems and human-computer interaction. I am currently looking for a research advisor for my first-year rotation.

I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at Yale (2023), where I was part of the [Yale Efficient Computing Lab](http://www.yecl.org/) group advised by [Lin Zhong](http://www.linzhong.org/). My research was on 5G Cloud RAN.
