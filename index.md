## About me
I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford, interested in the intersection of mobile embedded systems and human-computer interaction. I am currently looking for a research advisor for my first-year rotation.

I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at Yale (2023), where I was part of the [Yale Efficient Computing Lab](http://www.yecl.org/) Group advised by [Lin Zhong](http://www.linzhong.org/). My research was on 5G Cloud RAN.

## Current Research

**Junkyard Computing:** Manufacturing electronic devices is an energy-intensive process that dominates the lifetime carbon footprint of consumer electronics like smartphones. Options for dealing with end-of-life phones are limited, leading to a stockpile of environmentally costly, miniature computers. This is particularly unfortunate given that smartphones contain many components that could be useful for other applications—CPUs, GPUs, microphones, etc. Junkyard computing studies the repurposing of unwanted smartphones for a wide range of non-consumer applications. We are exploring two pathways: Datacenters and IoT. In the first, old phones are repurposed as general-purpose cloud compute nodes. In the second, they are redeployed as remote sensors.
